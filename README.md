# My custom boilerplate using React

## Technologies that I use :

- React
- Vite
- Typescript
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Lint staged
- Husky
- Styled components
- Vitest

### Explanation :

We need to make sure the code have a pattern, for this purpose is recommended the use of some tools to help this process.
for code style in this boilerplate we use prettier with eslint, to make sure our code style doesn't look like a Frankenstein. In the other side we need test to validate what we are building, because of this we use some test library, here we use vitest to unit test. To make sure we do not push incorrectly code for our repository we use lint-staged and husky, they have a pre-commit config, before we commit run some steps to validate if something is not okay.

### How to use

- 1 - We need the basic tools: nodejs, a code editor I personally recommend vscode,  coffee and git.
- 2 - We need to clone the template using the command: ***npx degit https://github.com/Jhonatanmizu/boilerplate_reactjs my-project-name***
- 3 - We need to install the dependencies of the project running ***yarn*** to install all libs, if you does not have yarn  installed on your machine please run ***npm i -g yarn*** to install yarn.
- 4 - Now we can run the boilerplate with ***yarn dev***
